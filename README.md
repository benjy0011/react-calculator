# react-calculator

This is a calculator web app (with a concept referring to the calculator I used during my secondary school) for freeCodeCamp Front End Libraries Certification. (the current code doesn't 100% pass the fcc test as I found one the test cases is not intuitive, but the current functionality is complete, you may tweak a little bit to pass the test)
